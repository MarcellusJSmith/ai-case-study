## Introduction
DeepL is a language translator that can be used online or downloaded as a desktop computer application, a web browser extension, or a mobile application. [According to DeepL's press information (n.d.)](https://www.deepl.com/press), the company was founded by Jaroslaw Kutylowski and launched in August 2017. (paras. 1-3) Kutylowski had previously worked on an online dictionary website called Linguee.com, and he created DeepL to use machine learning for a language translator that would be more accurate and reliable than other competing translators; [As Kutylowski said in his interview with Slator (Faes, 2021)](https://slator.com/deepl-got-machine-translation-plans-make-money/):

> Machine learning has always been at the heart of Linguee, so when neural networks became an option for machine translation, we saw an opening...Before neural machine translation was an option, we had always felt that given the massive resources invested by very large players into statistical machine translation models, we would not have been able to close the gap. (para. 6)

The company started to grow quickly after people saw the capabilities of DeepL and investors saw potential in a translator that uses neural networks. [According to Anna Wyndham's research (2023)](https://slator.com/inside-deepl-the-worlds-fastest-growing-most-secretive-machine-translation-company/), "The company attracted an investment from one of Silicon Valley’s most high-profile venture capital firms, Benchmark Capital, which took a 13.6% stake. Among other investors are btov, a European venture capital firm with offices in Germany, Switzerland, and Luxembourg" (para. 14).

## Business Activities
DeepL aims to provide a translator that uses neural machine translation for the most accurate interpretation of written or spoken foreign languages. DeepL markets their translator towards individuals who communicate with people who speak in different languages, and businesses that want to localize their works to people who speak a different native language. [Statistics from Acumen Research and Consulting published in January 2023](https://www.acumenresearchandconsulting.com/machine-translation-market#:~:text=Machine%20Translation%20Market%20Size%20%2D%20Global,Trends%20and%20Forecast%202022%20%2D%202030&text=The%20Global%20Machine%20Translation%20Market,19.9%25%20from%202022%20to%202030.) project that not only the market value and revenue from machine translation has been growing since 2021, but it will also continue to grow exponentially in the upcoming years.

DeepL claims that their translator has several key advantages against competing tech companies in the machine translation market. [According to one of DeepL's blog posts (2021)](https://www.deepl.com/en/blog/how-does-deepl-work), their translator uses higher quality training data, a supervised learning method that yields significant improvements, and a more efficient neural network. They also claim that their translator uses a modified Transformer architecture, a publically available translation system, which produces better translations [as DeepL explains in their blog post (2021)](https://www.deepl.com/en/blog/how-does-deepl-work):

> It is well known that most publicly available translation systems are direct modifications of the Transformer architecture. Of course, the neural networks of DeepL also contain parts of this architecture, such as attention mechanisms. However, there are also significant differences in the topology of the networks that lead to an overall significant improvement in translation quality over the public research state of the art. We see these differences in network architecture quality clearly when we internally train and compare our architectures and the best known Transformer architectures on the same data. (para. 2)

## Landscape
DeepL is a more recently established company in the machine translation field, but their translator had quickly set themselves apart from major tech corporations and their translator apps such as Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, and the translators present on websites such as Amazon and Facebook. One major factor in DeepL's success is their adoption of a Convolutional Neural Network or CNN. [According to a TechCrunch article by Coldewey & Lardinois (2017)](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/deepl-schools-other-online-translators-with-clever-machine-learning/), "Developments published by universities, research agencies and indeed Linguee’s competitors showed that convolutional neural networks were the way to go, rather than the recurrent neural networks the company had been using previously." (para. 12) This new trend was [described in a ScienceDirect research paper (Wang et al., 2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809921002745): Recurring Neural Networks or RNNs used to be common in neural machine translation, but RNN's dependency on previous words and CNN's ability to create hierarchical representations and have long-distance dependencies made it the better choice if it's properly trained and the inspiration for the Transformer network architecture. (p. 145)

## Results
DeepL's translator has been used by many people and is starting to become the most preferred option when it comes to machine translation. [According to one of DeepL's blog posts (2023)](https://www.deepl.com/en/blog/deepl-streamlines-localization-for-global-companies), their translator has been used to help these 3 companies with localization:

> Deutsche Bahn used DeepL to connect its global, multilingual workforce and ensure consistent, industry-specific communication. Weglot's customers benefitted from DeepL API’s incredible accuracy and efficient translations, saving them time and money when localizing their content. Alza integrated DeepL API to efficiently localize its website content into five different European languages, saving thousands of euros a month in operating costs (para. 1)

DeepL promotes their translator based on it producing the most preferred translation chosen by many human translators. [DeepL's press information (n.d.)](https://www.deepl.com/press) shows several graphs of professional translators reviewing 119 paragraphs of translated text, and an overwhelming majority of them prefer translations done by DeepL. (Charts 1-6) [Coldewey & Lardinois corroborate this in their TechCrunch article (2017)](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/deepl-schools-other-online-translators-with-clever-machine-learning/) by comparing translators themselves (paras. 2-3) and reported more results from DeepL's blind testing. (Charts 1-6)

## Closing Thoughts & Recommendations
If I were to advise DeepL, I would suggest that they put their efforts into having speech recognition and text-to-speech support for more languages. I have used DeepL's translator before and currently, only 4 languages have speech recognition support, and text-to-speech only works for English. I think DeepL should focus on this because I believe this will make their translator even better for localization purposes. The limitations of DeepL's translator, and Machine translation in general, when used for localization have been explained in [one of DeepL's blog posts (2024)](https://www.deepl.com/en/blog/navigating-localization-challanges-report): 

> Even as AI tools become more advanced, human involvement will remain an integral part of a successful content localization strategy. Machine translation isn’t perfect, and a human-in-the-loop approach is the key to success. A significant 82% expressed concerns about accurately translating industry-specific terms. For industry-specific jargon and vocabulary, companies should consider training custom machine translation models or selecting a machine translator that comes with a glossary feature. (paras. 15-21)

I believe that by having more speech support for their translator, DeepL can make it easier and accessible for humans to review translated text which can improve the quality of localized content. To do this, DeepL could utilize Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Speech Synthesis which are two AI-enhanced voice-based technologies. [According to Mikiko Bazeley in her tech blog (2022)](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/an-easy-introduction-to-speech-ai/), Speech AI has helped call centers become more efficient, accessible, and received better customer satisfaction. (para. 8) I think that this example shows that ASR and Speech Synthesis can benefit a multilingual company that communicates through translations, and provides their products and services for people with different native languages. DeepL has been a massive success so far, and I think making it more accessible with the use of Speech AI will help the translator and the company maintain its success.
